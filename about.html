                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Alex Lee, a passionate Computer Science student and software developer based in Brooklyn, New York. My journey into computer science began in middle school when I joined my school's robotics club. That experience ignited a deep curiosity about coding and problem-solving, and from that point on, I’ve been hooked. <br /> <br />
                    Over the years, I’ve grown to appreciate how technology can shape the world around us, and I’m driven by the idea of creating innovative solutions that improve people’s everyday lives. Whether it's through building intuitive software or solving complex challenges, I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and make an impact. <br /> <br />
                    I’m most proficient in Java and Python, but I’ve also worked with C, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS in past projects. I thrive in environments where creativity meets technical problem-solving, and I’m excited about contributing my skills to projects that make a real difference. </p>

                                Working as a waiter taught me a lot about teamwork and how important it is to communicate and coordinate with others to keep things running smoothly. 
                                Every day, I had to work closely with the kitchen staff and other servers to make sure orders came out right and customers were happy. <br><br>
                                It also taught me a lot about patience—whether it was dealing with difficult customers, handling last-minute requests, or juggling multiple tables at once. <br><br>
                                There’s nothing more stressful than a packed restaurant during a dinner rush, but learning to stay calm and focused in those high-pressure moments was invaluable. 
                                It pushed me to think on my feet, manage my time wisely, and solve problems quickly, all while keeping a smile on my face!
